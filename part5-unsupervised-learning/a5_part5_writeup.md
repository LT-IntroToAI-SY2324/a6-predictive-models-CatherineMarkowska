# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

# 1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
The purple group with low annual income and a low spending score are called "economical". This is because they do not buy above their means; they try to avoid spending all of their money on shopping.

The red group with a low annual income and a high spending score are called "spendthrift". This is because they spend their money in an extravagant and irresponsible way and also spend money that they might not have. 

The blue group with a medium annual income and medium spending score are called "thrifty". They are similar to the orange group in that they do not spend above their means, but they have more of a monetary buffer to buy more things.

The orange group with a high annual income and high spending score are called "lavish". They have a lot of money that they can spend generously on whatever they want. 

The green group with a high annual income and a low spending score are called "misers." They have a lot of money, but choose not to spend it. 

# 2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
A customer who as a medium income and low spending habits would be on the cusp of the blue group/"thrifty" group and the green group/"misers". 

# 3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
One cluster of interest to me is the low spending and low annual income (the purple group/the "economical" group) cluster. The marketing team might approach this specific customer group by highlighting deals and low prices that they have in order to encourage the cluster to spend more money without them feeling as though they are losing more money than they can spend.
