# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. ### What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r-squared value is 0.6257932855322312. It says that this linear regression model is moderately accurate, as it is approaacing the perfect r squared value of 1. Thus, predictions made using the graph have at least some correlation. 


2. ### According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is 137.46 mmHG.

3. ### How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
As stated above, I think that this model's predictions are moderately accurate, but cannot be used to make definitive statments. I do not think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age not only because the r squared value is not very close to 1, but also a myriad of factors come into play such as the person's weight or if they have any diseases or disorders. To improve the model, data sets such as the inclusion of a person's weight and heart health could increase the r squared score closer to 1.
